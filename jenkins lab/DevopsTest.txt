Qus-Demonstrate branching and merging and share your repository link.

Certainly, I can explain branching and merging in Git. Here's an example scenario to demonstrate how branching and merging works in Git:

Suppose you are working on a project in Git and you need to add a new feature to the code. You don't want to make changes directly to the main codebase, so you create a new branch to work on the feature.

Create a new branch: You can create a new branch by running the following command in Git:

git branch feature-branch

This creates a new branch called "feature-branch" that is identical to the current branch you're on.

Switch to the new branch: To switch to the new branch, run the following command:

git checkout feature-branch

This will switch you to the new branch, and any changes you make will only be made to this branch, not the main codebase.

Make changes and commit: You can now make changes to the codebase in the new branch. Once you've made the changes, you can commit them to the branch using the following command:

git commit -m "Added new feature"

This will save your changes to the branch.

Switch back to the main branch: Once you've made your changes in the feature branch, 
you can switch back to the main branch using the following command:

git checkout main

This will take you back to the main branch, which is where you started.

Merge the changes: To merge the changes you made in the feature branch back into the main branch, run the following command:

git merge feature-branch

This will merge the changes you made in the feature branch into the main branch. If there are any conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them.

Push changes: Finally, push the changes to the remote repository by running the following command:

git push

This will push the changes to the main branch on the remote repository, making them available to other developers.

That's a basic demonstration of branching and merging in Git.
